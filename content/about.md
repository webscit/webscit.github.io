<td>Frédéric Collonval, Founder

Frédéric has passed a Ph.D. in numerical simulations. Then he integrated
Safran group in which he maintained and developed multiple tools before
starting an internal start-up with some colleagues developing [CoSApp](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp) - a new simulation
framework to design complex systems that eventually got published
publicly.
During that period, he got more and more involved in the interactive-computing 
[Jupyter ecosystem](https://jupyter.org/). That materializes professionally by joining QuantStack - a company leader in Jupyter development - and on the
community by becoming a distinguish contributor
and the JupyterLab representative to the Jupyter software steering council in 2023.
